# Iris Dataset Predictor

## Machine Learning Model Flask App Local Deployment with a simple front end

This machine learning Flask app uses a trained model to predict the type of flower based on user-input data. The app has a simple front-end that prompts the user to input various features of the flower such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

The trained model uses a dataset of various flowers and their corresponding features to make predictions. The model has been trained using a simple neural network to ensure accurate predictions.

The app is built using Flask, a micro web framework in Python, making it easy to deploy and scale. The front-end is designed using HTML and CSS for a simple user interface.
